  Classes in JavaScript are like blueprints for creating objects. They define the properties and methods that objects created from the class will have. They allow you to create multiple objects with the same structure and behavior.
  Return Value
  The strchr function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string str, or NULL if the character is not found.

  Inheritance
  In JavaScript, inheritance lets one object take on the properties and methods of another object. This helps to create a hierarchy of objects, where each object can reuse code from its parent object.

  
  The <center> tag was used in older versions of HTML to center-align text or other content within a web page. However, it has been deprecated in HTML5, and its use is no longer recommended.
