In JavaScript, the super keyword is used inside a subclass constructor to call the parent class's constructor and access its methods. Here's a simple explanation:
Calling the Parent Constructor: Inside a subclass constructor, super() is used to call the constructor of the parent class. This initializes the subclass with the properties and behavior of the parent class.

Accessing Parent Methods: You can also use super.method() to call a specific method of the parent class from within a method of the subclass. This allows the subclass to use and extend the behavior of the parent class's methods.
